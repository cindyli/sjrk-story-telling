# Branches used for Storytelling Tool deployment

Various branches are present in [the main fork of this repository](https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling),
each of which has a specific purpose, such as being used to deploy particular versions of the site. The `master` branch
is an exception in that it is used both as the main branch of the project from which all new development should be started
(see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on that process), as well as the branch from which the Staging
site is deployed.

Authoring new stories is normally disabled on all deployed versions except the Staging site.
